# EPOCH OF EMBERS — Game Blueprint

## 1) Core Concept
**Genre:** Social strategy RPG + collection + narrative MMO-lite.

**Elevator pitch:**
Build a living settlement, lead a clan, discover ultra-rare dragons, and ascend from a humble village to cosmic sovereignty. Every choice shifts relationships, faction politics, and the metaphysical path from mortality to godhood.

**Player fantasy pillars**
1. **Architect** — Build and optimize a beautiful, efficient civilization.
2. **Warden** — Hunt, hatch, and evolve legendary dragons.
3. **Strategist** — Compete in PvP and coordinate in clan warfare.
4. **Seeker** — Uncover hidden lore and existential secrets.
5. **Ascendant** — Progress across scales: village → kingdom → planet → universe → godhood.

---

## 2) Audience + Positioning
- **Primary:** 16–35 strategy/collection players (Clash-like retention + creature collecting).
- **Secondary:** narrative RPG players who value consequences and philosophy.
- **Session shape:**
  - Short sessions (3–8 min): collect resources, queue upgrades, chat, quick raids.
  - Long sessions (20–45 min): events, story missions, clan operations, dragon hunts.

---

## 3) Gameplay Systems

### 3.1 Base Building (real-time)
- Grid/parcel-based settlement with roads, homes, production buildings, labs, shrines.
- Real-time construction timers with queue management.
- Happiness/social score from population needs, relationships, and aesthetics.
- Defensive layout influences raid pathing and tactical outcomes.

### 3.2 Resources
- **Core:** Gold, Food, Aether (magic energy).
- **Advanced:** Sigils, Relics, Star Matter, Covenant Threads.
- Inputs/outputs tied to building tiers + dragon boosts + NPC profession network.

### 3.3 Dragon Lifecycle (very rare)
1. **Hunt clues** (world map anomalies, rumors, faction intel).
2. **Expedition** (PvE tactical encounter or cooperative clan hunt).
3. **Egg recovery** (low drop rates, pity mechanics).
4. **Incubation** via habitat + catalyst materials.
5. **Bonding quests** unlock personality traits and battle perks.
6. **Evolution** via milestone rituals (scarcity + skill gates, not pure paywalls).

### 3.4 PvP + PvE
- **PvP Modes**
  - Asynchronous base raids (core economy loop).
  - Seasonal ranked skirmish with capped stat bands for fairness.
  - Clan territory control map with timed windows.
- **PvE Modes**
  - Story campaigns (branching chapters).
  - World bosses (daily/weekly collaborative goals).
  - Rift expeditions (roguelite modifiers).

### 3.5 Clan/Guild Systems
- Clan halls with shared progression.
- Cooperative dragon hunts and donation economy.
- Clan research tree (non-P2W utility and convenience).
- Diplomatic systems: alliances, treaties, betrayals (event-driven).

### 3.6 Daily Interactive Simulation
- Named NPCs with routines, preferences, relationship arcs.
- Daily dialogues reflect world state, player behavior, and moral choices.
- AI companions suggest objectives, react emotionally, and remember prior choices.

## 4) World + Narrative Framework

## 4.1 Setting
A post-modern civilization where arcane technology overlays ordinary life. Ancient star empires left hidden engines beneath cities. Dragons are living keys to cosmic layers of reality.

## 4.2 Progression Realms
1. **Village Age** — survival, local politics, first relics.
2. **Kingdom Age** — diplomacy, war logistics, dragon sanctums.
3. **Planetary Age** — continent governance, orbital threats.
4. **Universal Age** — cosmic factions, law-of-reality conflicts.
5. **Godhood Age** — metaphysical rule sets, ethical paradox endings.

## 4.3 Factions
- **The Concord of Glass** — order, surveillance, deterministic fate.
- **Ashen Pilgrims** — freedom, ambition, radical self-determination.
- **Choir of Tides** — empathy, collective consciousness, sacrifice.
- **Null Crown** — anti-meaning philosophy; power via entropy.

## 4.4 Story Architecture
- **Seasonal arcs** (10–12 weeks each).
- **Chapter nodes** with meaningful binary and tri-path decisions.
- **Consequences model** tracks:
  - Mercy vs utility
  - Freedom vs stability
  - Loyalty vs ambition
  - Truth vs comfort
- Multiple endings per season + cumulative account mythline.

## 4.5 Hidden Secrets Layer
- Ancient language puzzle chain across events.
- “False history” documents contradicted by dragon memory echoes.
- Community ARG-lite clues tied to world boss timelines.

   - Conflict: control vs compassion.
2. **Mira Solenne (Dragon Linguist)**

**Dragon design goals**
- Distinct silhouettes + emotional expressiveness.

## 7) Art + Animation Direction
- **Style:** cute-proportioned characters + detailed materials and VFX.
- **Camera:** 2.5D isometric with layered depth.
- **Movement:** soft, readable walk cycles inspired by Ice Age Village pacing.

## 8) Economy + Progression Systems

## 8.1 Meta Progression
- **Civilization Level** gates buildings/features.

- **Doctrine Web** talent graph with philosophical branches.
- **Codex Completion** from lore fragments, dragon records, and choices.

## 8.2 Fairness Controls
- No direct premium stat boosts in ranked PvP.

- Weeklies: clan objective, world event chapter, dragon trial.
- Seasonal: battle pass, story branch finale, faction score.

---

## 9) Ethical Monetization Model
1. **Cosmetics only power-neutral**
   - Dragon skins, building themes, UI frames, emotes.
2. **Battle Pass (free + premium tracks)**
   - Premium grants cosmetics, convenience, narrative side episodes.
3. **Optional expansions**
   - Standalone story arcs and cosmetic bundles.
4. **Quality-of-life purchases**

5. **No pay-to-win safeguards**
   - No premium-only combat stats.
   - Hard caps for any speed-up effects in competitive windows.
   - Full disclosure for drop rates and pity counters.

## 10) Technical Architecture (Android)
- **Client:** Unity (C#) or Godot 4 (GDScript/C#), Android export.
- **Backend:** Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Cloud Functions, Remote Config, Analytics, Crashlytics).
- **Realtime/MP:**
  - Async combat resolves via Cloud Functions.
  - Optional real-time features via WebSockets + relay service.
- **Cloud save:** Firestore profile + secure restore with account binding.
- **Anti-cheat basics:** server-authoritative economy writes, signed battle seeds, anomaly detection.

**Suggested stack choice:**
